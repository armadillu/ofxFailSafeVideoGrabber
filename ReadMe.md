Simple OpenFrameworks Addon intended to be a fail-safe replacement for ofVideoGrabber. It will mostly wrap it, but if there's no camera available, a safety measure will be taken so you can still run the project. A backup movie file will be used (if provided by the user) if no videoGrabber is available, and as a last resort, if a movie file is not available either, an ofImage with pixel noise will be provided.
